# Convenience .html File Viewer

Github, unfortunately, does not automatically render .html files. The RMarkdown files are saved as .html files, meaning that readers must either download these files and view them on their own computer or access an alternative method for viewing them in their browswer. Toward this end, hyperlinks to the files in their correct format have been created below so that readers may view them easily. Click the links below to view the rendered .html versions of the RMarkdown supplemental materials.
