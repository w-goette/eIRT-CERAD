# Explanatory Item Response Theory Models of the CERAD List Learning Test

This repository serves as a central place to keep R scripts and supplementary materials for publications related to the application of explanatory item response theory models to the CERAD List Learning test. As projects are started and publications are made, this material will be updated to help readers keep track of files and related materials.

These materials correspond to the application of explanatory item response theory to the immediate recall trials of the CERAD List Learning test. Included among these materials are pre-regristration and scientific transparency resources. Unfortunately, the data used for these analyses cannot be released without appropriate data requests and signing of data use agreements. Above is a link for accessing the primary data source for those interested in accessing the data. With this exception, the goal of all other materials is to ensure reproducability of all results and open transparency of all modeling results and methods. Toward that end, Markdown documents (saved as .html files) are available under Supplementary Materials in order to provide extensive review of all results and methods. Additionally, all R code used to clean the original data files, code and test models, and perform post-processing is provided through the table above. Within that same section is also the .rmd files use to create the Markdown documents so that readers can access that information directly. The OSF link is an alternative storage location for the R files that is slightly more harmonious with the AsPredicted pre-registration but otherwise is redundant to this Github page.
